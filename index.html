    <h2>ðŸŽ‰ Thank You for Participating!</h2>
    <p>
      Your contribution to the Union Trusted Ceremony model signifies more than just a simulationâ€”it represents your commitment to decentralization, security, and trust.
      Just like every participant in the actual ceremony, your action here strengthens the belief that zero-knowledge cryptography can be built by and for the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each small stepâ€”every setup, every signature, every verificationâ€”brings us closer to a future where trust is truly interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>We are Union.</p>
